# Claude Conscript Plugin — Usage Guide

[Conscript](https://docs.totalinsightmanagement.com/congame/Conscript.html) is
a DSL for authoring online experiments, built on the
[congame](https://github.com/MarcKaufmann/congame) framework. This
plugin teaches Claude how to write, review, and deploy Conscript studies.

## Prerequisites

- **Racket** installed with congame packages (see
  [congame docs](https://docs.totalinsightmanagement.com/congame/))
- **A project directory** with study `.rkt` files (or an empty one to
  start)
- **Claude Code** — CLI, VS Code extension, or desktop app

## Setup

### CLI

```bash
cd ~/projects/your-study-project
claude --plugin-dir ~/projects/claude-conscript-plugin
```

### VS Code

1. Install the [Claude Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropics.claude-code) from the VS Code marketplace
2. Open your study project folder in VS Code
3. Add the plugin path to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["~/projects/claude-conscript-plugin"]
   }
   ```
4. Open the Claude Code panel in VS Code and use skills as normal

VS Code is recommended for users who prefer a GUI — it provides an
editor for `.rkt` files alongside Claude's output.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/create-study` | Generate a new study. On first run, asks about your project to create a `study-config.md` that persists your answers for all future runs. Then generates a `.rkt` file. |
| `/study-review` | QA an existing study against a checklist |
| `/upload` | Deploy a study to a congame server |

## Creating your first study

```
/create-study Participants see draws from an urn and report beliefs
```

On first run, Claude asks setup questions (research domain, typical
structure, where your congame repo is). This is one-time — answers are
saved to `study-config.md` so future runs skip straight to generation.

After setup, Claude generates a `.rkt` file with all required parts:
steps, forms, variables, study flow, CSS, and a `-with-admin` variant
(a wrapper that adds bot models for automated testing).

## Reviewing and uploading

```
/study-review studies/my-study.rkt
/upload my-study
```

## Key concepts for newcomers

- **Study:** A sequence of steps (pages) participants go through
- **Step:** One page — can show content, collect form input, or run logic
- **`-with-admin` variant:** Every study needs one. It wraps the study
  with bot models so you can test it without clicking through manually.
- **Bot models:** Automated test actors that drive a headless Firefox
  browser via Marionette, filling forms and clicking buttons to verify
  the study works.
- **`study-config.md`:** Created by `/create-study` on first use. Stores
  your project's domain, study patterns, and paths to example repos.
  Read by Claude on every future `/create-study` invocation.
